# AS PHP coding standards

This composer package handles the dependencies and config for the PHP coding standards. For all other AS coding standards, use the npm package `@atomicsmash/coding-standards`.

## To release a new version:
1. Make any changes you need to the package
2. Merge into main
3. Create a new tag with the new version number, which will automatically push to packagist.
This could be automated later with auto tag creation on merge to main, but currently it's a manual process.
